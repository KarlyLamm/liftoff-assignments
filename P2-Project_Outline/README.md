For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Are you craving to get away, but don't know where to begin with planning? You've come to the right spot! Travel Roulette is the ideal app for the adventuress spirit with an indecisive running mind. Simply pick a state, and a to-do list will be auto-generated for you, along with flight details, and driving directions.

Your generated to-do list features restaurants, excursions, and a top free excursion. Happy traveling!
### Features
Features that Travel Roulette will have include a user login for users to keep track of where they have traveled, a flight API to link real flight prices, as well as a google maps API to include driving directions, and a post section for users to write about their experience on their excursion. 
### Technologies
I will be using JavaScript, and angularJS from unit 1. 
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn more about application programming interface, and am currently learning about regex to add a feature that will correct the user if they do not fill in an item.
